**Floraquest The Last Seed** is a game created with Unity and C#. It is a 2D adventure game where you have to find the last seed. This project is the result of my own Game jam Plus 2023 competition as a Game Designer
**Synopsis: **
The world is on the brink of collapse. All the plant life are nearly gone, leaving behind a barren and hostile landscape. 
You are the chosen one, our last hope. You have to diecover the last seed, a rare and precious artifact that could restore the greenery 
and beauty of the earth. But you are not alone. There are others who want the seed for their own selfish purposes, 
and they will stop at nothing to get it. You must protect the seed from them, and find a safe place to plant it. 
Along the way, you will encounter dangers, puzzles, and allies. You will also have to make choices that will affect the fate of the world. 
Will you be able to save the earth with the last seed?
